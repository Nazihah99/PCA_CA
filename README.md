## Methodology
Dimensionality Reduction using PCA
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is utilized to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, allowing for a more efficient and informative clustering process. The optimal number of principal components is determined using a scree plot, capturing a significant proportion of the total variance while minimizing error.

## Clustering Algorithms
Two clustering algorithms, K-means and K-medoids, are applied to both the original dataset and the reduced principal components. The Silhouette Score and Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) are utilized to identify the optimal number of clusters (k) for each scenario.

## Results
The chosen clustering methodology, K-medoids with PCA, is presented as the preferred approach for investigating the correlation between air pollution and mortality. The advantages of this method over traditional regression analysis are emphasized, highlighting its ability to provide more dependable and comprehensible results.
